<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Joyet George</h1>

-  I’m looking to collaborate on **OpenSource projects**

-  All of my projects are available at [https://jogeo.me/](https://jogeo.me/)

-  How to reach me? **joyetgeorge@gmail.com**

-  Experimenting with **Java** and **Kotlin**.


i am an aspiring full-stack developer, doing my bachelor's in computer applications from Don Bosco Arts and Science College. Currently, I am focusing on the app development field and have done some projects on Android applications.

In my free time, I participate in competitive programming challenges on platforms like Codechef and HackerRank. Apart from that, I love to use Linux and have a good understanding of Linux shell scripting.

I’m also familiar with a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Kotlin but I’m always adding new skills to my resume. I’m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
